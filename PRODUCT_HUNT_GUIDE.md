### First Comment (prepared in advance)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm excited to share Anki MCP - a project that connects Claude AI with Anki for AI-powered flashcard learning.

**Why I built this:**

As a heavy Anki user, I found myself spending too much time:
- Manually creating flashcards from articles and notes
- Trying to follow best practices for card creation
- Analyzing which cards were difficult and why

With Claude's capabilities through MCP, all of this became automated.

**What makes it special:**

🤖 55 tools covering everything from card generation to analytics
📊 Smart insights about your learning patterns
🔄 Batch operations (import CSV, export Markdown, etc.)
💬 Natural language - just tell Claude what you need

**Tech stack:**

- Python 3.11+ with async/await
- MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Pydantic for type safety
- AnkiConnect for Anki integration

**Open source (MIT license)** - contributions welcome!

Happy to answer any questions about the project, the tech behind it, or how you can use it for your own learning.

Try it out and let me know what you think!
